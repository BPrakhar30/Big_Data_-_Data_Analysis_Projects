**Wind Generation Data Analysis**

**Overview**

This project is centered around the analysis of wind generation data. The aim is to understand the patterns in wind generation, identify the influence of time on wind generation, and forecast future wind generation using ARIMA modeling.

**Data Preprocessing**

Data Loading and Cleaning: Wind generation data is loaded and cleaned using Pandas. Missing values are filled with column means.

Time Series Preparation: Date and time columns are combined to create a DateTime index for the dataset.

**Analysis**

Time Series Resampling: Data is resampled to analyze daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly patterns.

Visualization: Plots are generated to visualize wind generation trends over different time frames.

Percent Change Analysis: Percentage changes in wind generation over various time frames are calculated and visualized.

Autocorrelation Analysis: Autocorrelation is computed for different lags to understand the temporal dependencies in the data.

Persistence Benchmarking: A persistence model is used as a benchmark for forecasting accuracy.

**Modeling**

Simple Moving Average (SMA): SMA is used to forecast wind generation. The model's mean absolute error (MAE) is computed and compared against the persistence benchmark.

ARIMA Modeling: An ARIMA model is constructed to forecast wind generation. Parameters are optimized based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

**Key Findings**

Wind generation shows distinct daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly patterns.

The ARIMA model with optimized parameters outperforms the simple moving average and persistence models in terms of forecasting accuracy.

**Technologies Used**

Python for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas for data preprocessing.

Matplotlib for data visualization.

Statsmodels for ARIMA modeling.

**Conclusion**

The analysis highlights the cyclical nature of wind generation and demonstrates the effectiveness of ARIMA modeling in forecasting. This analysis can aid in optimizing wind energy utilization and planning.

**Rainfall and Vegetation Analysis in Rwanda**

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis and modeling project focused on exploring the relationship between rainfall and vegetation in Rwanda. Using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and scikit-learn, the project demonstrates various data manipulation, visualization, and regression modeling techniques.

**Key Features**

**Data Processing and Visualization**

Data Import: Utilizes pandas to import and preprocess two datasets: 'RwandaDistrictRainfall.csv' and 'RwandaDistrictVegetation.csv', ensuring clean and usable data by handling missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Extracts key features from the datasets, such as districts and months, and reshapes the data for further analysis.

Data Visualization: Employs matplotlib for creating a series of line plots that depict rainfall and vegetation trends across different districts in Rwanda over time.

**Statistical Analysis and Modeling**

Statistical Summary: Calculates mean, median, minimum, and maximum values for both rainfall and vegetation, offering a statistical overview of the datasets.

Correlation Analysis: Investigates the correlation between rainfall and vegetation data, incorporating techniques like Haversine distance computation and correlation matrices.

Regression Models: Fits linear, quadratic, and cubic regression models to the data, assessing the relationship between rainfall and vegetation. The models' performance is evaluated using R2, Adjusted R2, and RMSE scores.

**Advanced Modeling Techniques**

Train-Test Split Analysis: Implements regression models using a train-test split approach to validate model performance.

Random Forest and Support Vector Regression: Explores advanced regression models like RandomForestRegressor and SVR, comparing their performance against polynomial regression models.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates an in-depth analysis of environmental data, leveraging Python's powerful data analysis libraries to uncover insights into the relationship between rainfall and vegetation in Rwanda. The repository serves as a practical example of applying statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world environmental data.
